# Portfolio-Project
This is Charlie Knight's Portfolio project, and it is hopefully where I will showcase my skills as a web developer. It will also act as a hub for future projects. The portfolio presents my name, links to sections about me, placeholders for future work, and how to contact me. Clicking a link from the navigation bar takes the user to the corresponding section. The first image of my work is larger and takes the user to google.com for the time being. 

Still needed: Photo/Avatar in the about me, placeholder links for other 4 images, Resume/Contact Me links, text blocks in the images, media queries for a more responsive layout, refactoring for best practices/naming structures.
